# Postmark Webhook Issue - Debug Report

## Executive Summary

**Problem**: Postmark inbound webhook is NOT detecting email replies, preventing automatic escrow payment release.

**Status**:
- ‚úÖ Outbound emails sent successfully via Postmark
- ‚úÖ Recipients receive emails and can reply
- ‚úÖ Senders receive the replies
- ‚ùå Postmark inbound webhook is NEVER triggered

**Impact**: Core business logic broken - cannot automatically detect responses and release payments.

---

## System Architecture

### Platform: FASTPASS Escrow Payment System
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript (Vercel)
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Edge Functions)
- **Email Provider**: Postmark
- **Payment**: Stripe

### Email Flow (Current Implementation)

```
1. Sender pays ‚Üí Creates message in database
2. Postmark sends email to Receiver
   - From: FASTPASS <noreply@fastpass.email>
   - To: receiver@example.com
   - Reply-To: 3e25f9d6075c2e558e480850eee96513@inbound.postmarkapp.com
   - Subject: üí∞ Guaranteed Message (‚Ç¨15.00) - Response within 48 hours

3. Receiver replies to email
   - Reply should go to: 3e25f9d6075c2e558e480850eee96513@inbound.postmarkapp.com

4. Postmark should POST to webhook:
   - URL: https://znncfayiwfamujvrprvf.supabase.co/functions/v1/postmark-webhook-public
   - Expected: HTTP 200 response
   - ACTUAL: Webhook is NEVER called (no activity in Postmark dashboard)

5. Webhook should:
   - Detect response via In-Reply-To header
   - Mark response as received
   - Release escrow payment (75% to receiver, 25% platform)
   - Forward response to original sender
```

## What We've Tested

### Test Scenario 1: Direct Inbound Test Emails
- **Method**: Sent emails directly to `3e25f9d6075c2e558e480850eee96513@inbound.postmarkapp.com`
- **Result**: Webhook receives POST, returns HTTP 200 with "No matching message found"
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Webhook works when emails sent directly to inbound address

### Test Scenario 2: Production Flow (Current Issue)
- **Method**:
  1. Created payment via `https://fastpass.email/pay/[user-id]`
  2. Email sent via Postmark with Reply-To: inbound address
  3. Receiver replies to email
  4. Sender receives reply
- **Result**: Postmark shows NO inbound activity, webhook NEVER called
- **Status**: ‚ùå Replies do NOT reach Postmark inbound system

### Test Scenario 3: Webhook URL Verification
- **Manual Test**: `curl -X POST [webhook-url]` with test JSON
- **Result**: Returns HTTP 200
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Webhook endpoint is accessible and responding

---

## Current Hypothesis

**The Issue**: Email clients may be routing replies to `noreply@fastpass.email` instead of the Reply-To address.

**Why This Matters**:
- Reply-To header: `3e25f9d6075c2e558e480850eee96513@inbound.postmarkapp.com`
- From header: `FASTPASS <noreply@fastpass.email>`
- Some email clients prioritize From over Reply-To
- If reply goes to `noreply@fastpass.email`, Postmark never receives it

**Evidence**:
- Postmark Activity shows ZERO inbound emails when replies are sent
- Direct emails TO the inbound address work perfectly
- Webhook is properly configured and responds correctly

## Technical Details

### Outbound Email Configuration (postmark-send-message function)

```typescript
{
  From: 'FASTPASS <noreply@fastpass.email>',
  To: recipientEmail,
  ReplyTo: '3e25f9d6075c2e558e480850eee96513@inbound.postmarkapp.com',
  Subject: `üí∞ Guaranteed Message (${amount}‚Ç¨) - Response within ${deadline}`,
  HtmlBody: htmlContent,
  TextBody: textContent,
  MessageStream: 'outbound',
  TrackOpens: true,
  TrackLinks: 'HtmlAndText',
  Headers: [
    { Name: 'X-Fastpass-Message-Id', Value: messageId }
  ],
  Metadata: {
    messageId: messageId,
    senderEmail: senderEmail
  }
}
```

### Webhook Function (postmark-inbound-webhook)

**URL**: `https://znncfayiwfamujvrprvf.supabase.co/functions/v1/postmark-inbound-webhook`

**Authentication**: Public (verify_jwt = false)

**Logic**:
1. Receives Postmark inbound JSON payload
2. Extracts In-Reply-To header to match original message
3. Looks up message in database via email_logs table
4. If found and within deadline: releases escrow funds
5. Forwards response to original sender
6. Returns HTTP 200 with processing status

**Current Status**:
- ‚úÖ Returns HTTP 200 for all scenarios
- ‚úÖ Handles errors gracefully
- ‚ùå Never receives inbound emails from Postmark

### Database Schema

**email_logs table** (tracks outbound emails):
```sql
- message_id: uuid (FK to messages)
- email_provider_id: text (Postmark MessageID)
- email_type: 'new_message_notification'
- email_service_provider: 'postmark'
- response_detected_at: timestamp
```

**email_response_tracking table** (tracks responses):
```sql
- message_id: uuid
- original_email_id: text (from In-Reply-To header)
- response_received_at: timestamp
- response_detected_method: 'webhook' | 'manual' | 'grace_period'
- within_deadline: boolean
```

## What We've Already Fixed

1. ‚úÖ **HTTP 500 errors**: Fixed database query join issues
2. ‚úÖ **Migration applied**: email_response_tracking table exists in production
3. ‚úÖ **Authentication**: Added verify_jwt = false for public webhook access
4. ‚úÖ **Reply-To routing**: Changed from sender email to Postmark inbound address
5. ‚úÖ **Response forwarding**: Added automatic forwarding to original sender
6. ‚úÖ **Error handling**: All webhook responses return HTTP 200

## Questions for Postmark Expert

### Primary Question
**Why are email replies NOT reaching Postmark's inbound system when Reply-To header is set to the inbound address?**

### Specific Areas to Investigate

1. **Email Client Behavior**:
   - Do major email clients (Gmail, Outlook) honor Reply-To headers?
   - Is there a better way to force replies through Postmark?

2. **Postmark Inbound Configuration**:
   - Do we need MX records for `fastpass.email` pointing to Postmark?
   - Is there a special configuration needed beyond the webhook URL?
   - Does "Test Mode" affect inbound email processing?

3. **Alternative Solutions**:
   - Should we use email forwarding instead of Reply-To?
   - Should we configure `info@fastpass.email` to forward to inbound address?
   - Is there a Postmark-specific header or configuration we're missing?

4. **Debugging Steps**:
   - How can we trace where replies are actually going?
   - Can Postmark logs show rejected/lost inbound emails?
   - Are there Postmark API endpoints to manually check for inbound emails?

---

## Reproduction Steps

### Step 1: Send Test Email
```bash
curl -X POST \
  "https://znncfayiwfamujvrprvf.supabase.co/functions/v1/postmark-send-message" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer [SUPABASE_ANON_KEY]" \
  -d '{
    "recipientEmail": "marc.bernard@ece-france.com",
    "senderEmail": "test@example.com",
    "senderMessage": "Test message for webhook",
    "messageId": "[UUID]",
    "paymentAmount": 15,
    "responseDeadline": "48 hours"
  }'
```

### Step 2: Check Email
- Recipient receives email from `FASTPASS <noreply@fastpass.email>`
- Reply-To header shows: `3e25f9d6075c2e558e480850eee96513@inbound.postmarkapp.com`

### Step 3: Reply to Email
- Click "Reply" in email client
- Send response

### Step 4: Observe Issue
- ‚úÖ Original sender receives the reply (somehow)
- ‚ùå Postmark Inbound Activity shows ZERO emails
- ‚ùå Webhook is NEVER triggered

## Expected vs Actual Behavior

### Expected Flow
```
1. Email sent with Reply-To: [inbound-address]
2. User replies ‚Üí Email goes to [inbound-address]
3. Postmark receives email at inbound stream
4. Postmark POSTs to webhook URL
5. Webhook processes, releases funds, forwards to sender
```

### Actual Flow
```
1. Email sent with Reply-To: [inbound-address] ‚úÖ
2. User replies ‚Üí Email goes to ??? ‚ùì
3. Postmark receives: NOTHING ‚ùå
4. Postmark POSTs: NEVER HAPPENS ‚ùå
5. Sender still receives reply somehow ‚ùì
```

## Critical Missing Piece

**The sender receives the reply, but we don't know how or from where.**

This suggests:
- Replies may be going directly to sender (bypassing Postmark)
- Email client may be ignoring Reply-To header
- There may be a configuration issue with how Postmark handles Reply-To

---

## Success Criteria

The issue will be resolved when:

1. ‚úÖ User replies to email
2. ‚úÖ Email reaches Postmark inbound address
3. ‚úÖ Postmark Activity shows inbound email received
4. ‚úÖ Webhook receives POST request from Postmark
5. ‚úÖ Webhook processes response and releases escrow
6. ‚úÖ Original sender receives forwarded reply
