## 🚀 Deployment Commands

### Quick Deploy (All at Once)
```bash
# Deploy all Edge Functions
npx supabase functions deploy \
  check-escrow-timeouts \
  distribute-escrow-funds \
  stripe-connect-webhook \
  retry-failed-transfers \
  daily-reconciliation

# Verify deployment
npx supabase functions list

# Check logs
npx supabase functions logs check-escrow-timeouts --limit 10
npx supabase functions logs distribute-escrow-funds --limit 10
```

### Step-by-Step Deploy (Recommended)
```bash
# 1. Deploy critical fixes first
npx supabase functions deploy check-escrow-timeouts
npx supabase functions deploy distribute-escrow-funds
npx supabase functions deploy stripe-connect-webhook

# 2. Verify they work
npx supabase functions logs check-escrow-timeouts --tail &
npx supabase functions logs distribute-escrow-funds --tail &

# Wait 5 minutes, watch for errors

# 3. Deploy new functions
npx supabase functions deploy retry-failed-transfers
npx supabase functions deploy daily-reconciliation

# 4. Test new functions
curl -X POST https://YOUR_PROJECT.supabase.co/functions/v1/retry-failed-transfers \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SERVICE_KEY"

curl -X POST https://YOUR_PROJECT.supabase.co/functions/v1/daily-reconciliation \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SERVICE_KEY"
```

## ⚙️ Post-Deployment Configuration

### 1. Stripe Webhook Configuration
**CRITICAL**: Must be done immediately after deployment

1. Go to: https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks
2. Click "Add endpoint"
3. Enter URL: `https://YOUR_PROJECT.supabase.co/functions/v1/stripe-connect-webhook`
4. Select events:
   - ✅ `account.updated`
   - ✅ `payment_intent.succeeded`
   - ✅ `payment_intent.payment_failed`
   - ✅ `transfer.created`
   - ✅ `transfer.failed`
   - ✅ `transfer.reversed`
5. Copy "Signing secret"
6. Add to Supabase: Settings → Edge Functions → Secrets
   - Name: `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
   - Value: `whsec_...`

### 2. Verify GitHub Secrets
Ensure these are set: https://github.com/YOUR_REPO/settings/secrets/actions

- ✅ `SUPABASE_URL`
- ✅ `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`

### 3. Enable GitHub Actions Workflows
- Go to: https://github.com/YOUR_REPO/actions
- Enable workflows if disabled
- Verify they're scheduled correctly

## 🧪 Verification Tests

### Test 1: Atomic Locking (Critical)
```bash
# Try to process same transaction twice simultaneously
# Should fail on second attempt

transaction_id="YOUR_TEST_TRANSACTION_ID"

curl -X POST .../distribute-escrow-funds \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $SERVICE_KEY" \
  -d "{\"escrowTransactionId\":\"$transaction_id\"}" &

curl -X POST .../distribute-escrow-funds \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $SERVICE_KEY" \
  -d "{\"escrowTransactionId\":\"$transaction_id\"}" &

# Expected: First succeeds, second fails with "already processing"
```

### Test 2: Webhook Signature (Critical)
```bash
# Send fake webhook without signature
curl -X POST .../stripe-connect-webhook \
  -d '{"type":"payment_intent.succeeded","data":{}}'

# Expected: 400 Bad Request - Invalid signature
```

### Test 3: Circuit Breaker
```bash
# Check circuit breaker logs if cron runs
npx supabase functions logs check-escrow-timeouts | grep "CIRCUIT BREAKER"

# Should see nothing unless >50 timeouts occurred
```

### Test 4: Retry Function
```bash
# Should return zero failed transfers to retry
curl -X POST .../retry-failed-transfers \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $SERVICE_KEY"

# Expected: {"success":true,"found":0,"retried":0,...}
```

### Test 5: Daily Reconciliation
```bash
# Should return yesterday's stats
curl -X POST .../daily-reconciliation \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $SERVICE_KEY"

# Expected: Full stats breakdown
```

- ✅ Daily reconciliation
- ✅ Webhook signature verification
- ✅ Comprehensive error states
- ✅ Automatic retry logic
- ✅ Admin alerts for failures

**Result**: Enterprise-grade financial safety

## 🔄 Self-Healing Capabilities

### Automatic Recovery
1. **Transfer fails** → Marked for retry → Retried hourly → Admin alerted
2. **Capture fails** → Rolled back to 'held' → Can retry → No money stuck
3. **Webhook duplicate** → Detected → Ignored → No double processing
4. **Race condition** → Second process blocked → No conflict → Safe
5. **Mass timeout** → Circuit breaker triggers → Gradual processing → No overload

### Manual Intervention Only Needed For
- Receiver's Stripe account suspended (rare)
- Stripe API completely down (rare)
- Business logic changes

**Target**: <5% operations requiring manual intervention
